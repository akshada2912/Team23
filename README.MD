In Settle It, we provide users with a smooth and convenient way of splitting the money between themselves. The user can add friends, add groups, and splitting money qually or unequally.

We have not used any external frameworks or packages.

The first page run by flask will be the registration page-which will take the user to their account page. From there, they can easily navigate via the navbar to the friends, groups, add expense and home pages.

    In the friends page, they can add friends to their server.
    In the groups page, they can add a new group, the number of members and the members from their friends.
    The account page displays details about the user and allows them to edit the same.
    The add expenses page allows the user to add expenses with a group or a friend, and to divide the amount equally or unequally between the choices.
    The home page displays what SETTLE IT is about as well as information about the creators.

All this is tied together with a smooth, simple to navigate, beautiful interface to attract the user and provide ease of service.
